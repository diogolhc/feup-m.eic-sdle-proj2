## Description

This project implements a decentralized timeline service (P2P) using the Kademlia protocol. The service allows users to post messages to their timeline, and to follow other users' timelines. Being a decentralized service, the messages are stored in a distributed manner, meaning that the messages are not stored in a single machine, but in multiple machines.

For more information, please refer to the [project report](./doc/report.pdf).  
A video demonstration can also be found [here](./doc/demo.mp4).
